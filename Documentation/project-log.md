  * Researching using the HTML area and map tag to make CTA Map interactive. 
  * Successfully added a test and map tag. 
  * The pixel coordinates change with the scalling of the image so far. I'm unsure if this is the right approach, I will be researching to see if someone else has built something similar.

  * Got the API to display the map, but I'm having trouble having the key to work in the .env. The example I'm followig along with is using typescript and next.js and i think there is something that i have to retool for things to work properly. Also whats is odd is that when i console.log the API key it will log the key twice.
 
  * Restarting my computer seemed to get things going and now I have some wierd glitches with git hub.
